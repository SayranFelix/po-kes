A simple package containing jokes, and others kiddings...

### Pokes Origin. 
> The name Pokes arose from the junction of the names Polar + Jokes, thus was created "Pokes".

### How to use
> To return a random joke, follow this exemple:
```js
const Pokes = require("po-kes")  // requiring po-kes
let joke = Pokes.Joke("pt")  // return a random joke in portuguese
console.log(joke)  // [RETURNS]: "Você conhece a piada do pônei? Pô nei eu..."
```
_Currently this package has the languages: **portuguese** and **english**. (in use: **"pt"** to portuguese, or **"en"** to english)_
