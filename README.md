### Pokes Origin.

```js
const Pokes = require("po-kes")  // - Setting "po-kes".
let joke = Pokes.Joke("pt")  // - Return a random Joke in Portuguese, default language is "pt (Português-Brasil)".
console.log(joke)  // - [Logged]: "Você conhece a piada do pônei? Pô nei eu..."
```
_Currently this package has the languages: **portuguese** and **english**. (in use: **"pt"** to portuguese, or **"en"** to english)_
